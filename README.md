* Adhere to the MVC file structure: Models, Views, Controllers
* At least one model with all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD.
* A git repository not inside the class repo.
* At least one Github commit per day.
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
* A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc
* Have a link to your hosted working app in the README.md file in your github repo
* Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow

#### Stretch Goals
* Two models
* EJS Partials 
* Include portfolio-quality styling
* Use a CSS framework like Skeleton or Bootstrap

### Unsolved Problems 
* Users who did not create the color are able to delete
* No redirect for incorrect password or username
